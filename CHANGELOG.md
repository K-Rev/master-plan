## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0] - 2017-08-17

New option flag: `--render-parse-error` which will render the image with the
parsing error text, instead of printing to standard output. Also, the exit code
will be normal.

## [0.2.0] - 2017-08-15

Changed completely the language syntax. This change breaks compatibility with
all existing `.plan` file, but I'm releasing as a minor version because this
project's API is still experimental (under version 1.x.x).

## [0.1.0] - 2017-08-13

Initial release.
